I ran into a lot of issues, especially with the first client file.
To be honest, I just learned python and somehow did everything wrong

client.py issues:
bad command line argument handling - have no idea
literally all my error handling was wrong (issues 2, 3, 5, 6) - fixed by adding proper error titling and using sys.stderr isntead of print - somehow still doesn't work
code can't send file correctly, keeps adding something at the front????

server.py issues
