I ran into a lot of issues, especially with the first client file.
To be honest, I just learned python and somehow did everything wrong
I also did this last minute and it was a mistake

code references I used:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.listen
class tutorials I sorta listened to
https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/a-complete-guide-to-socket-programming-in-python (didn't listen very well)
https://realpython.com/python-sockets/


client.py issues:
bad command line argument handling - have no idea
literally all my error handling was wrong (issues 2, 3, 5, 6) - fixed by adding proper error titling and using sys.stderr isntead of print - somehow still doesn't work
code can't send file correctly, keeps adding something at the front????
tried to rewrite code, made it worse actually

server.py issues
literally nothing works good lord
got error hadling kinda working and now it can take a collection
most issues seems to be the terrible no good client that I'm still struggling to fix
